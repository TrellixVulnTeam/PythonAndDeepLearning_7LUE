In class exercise:

•	takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one
- the purpose here is how to take advantage of the tuples when we are using the list.

 for programming this you may want to follow this approach, 
 1. having two list one for your words like : ["PHP", "Exercises", "Backend"]
 2. one for keeping the count of the letters in each word like word_len
 3. then iterate through the word_list, then append the LEN of each word to the list
4. you will have a list which contains both the word and len of the word like this [(3,”php),(9,”Exercises”), (7,”backend”)].

5. Then sort this list
6. then return the last tuple


•	Read a file which contains one word in each line. Then Calculate the character frequency in each line




•	Draw a Game board

This one is 3x3 (like in tic tac toe). Obviously, they come in many other sizes (8x8 for chess)
Ask the user what size game board they want to draw, and draw it for them to the screen using 
Python’s print statement. Hint: use functions. 
 
              heightinp= int(input("Enter the height of the board: "))
         widthinp= int(input("Enter the width of the board: "))
         board_draw(heightinp,widthinp)
